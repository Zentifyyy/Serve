# Serve 

Serve was made in less than 12 hours and is my introduction to RayLib and game development in C++. Serve is a Pong game, in which your goal is to hit the ball back to the enemy and get the ball past them while simultaneously trying to block the enemies' shots. If the ball gets past your player character, then the opposition gains a point and vice versa.  

## Installation 

#### For pre-compiled binaries, check the [Github Releases](https://github.com/Zentifyyy/Serve/releases) page. 

#### To build and edit this project for yourself, refer to [the template page](https://github.com/raylib-extras/raylib-quickstart). 

## Additional 

- Serve supports window re-sizing and should be compatible with Windows, MacOS and Linux (MacOS and Linux not tested) thanks to the [RayLib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) library used to make this game. 

- Serve isn't supposed to be a fully fleshed out game, this was just a small project that I could develop in under a day to get started with using Raylib, further development is not guaranteed but may happen.
